# Getting Started
Start your own project folder with a git clone, and if you plan to push this clone to GitHub, you'll need to change your origin:

cd ~/Github\ Projects/

git clone git@github.com:boazblake/boilerplate.git NEWPROJECT

cd NEWPROJECT

git remote remove origin

git remote add origin YOUR_SSH_ADDRESS

#Install prerequisites

npm install
